\title{Computes random forest-based AUC}
\usage{
smdi_rf(
  data = NULL,
  covar = NULL,
  train_test_ratio = c(0.7, 0.3),
  set_seed = 42,
  ntree = 1000,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe or tibble object with partially observed/missing variables}

\item{covar}{character covariate or covariate vector with partially observed variable/column name(s) to investigate. If NULL, the function automatically includes all columns with at least one missing observation and all remaining covariates will be used as predictors}

\item{train_test_ratio}{numeric vector to indicate the test/train split ratio, e.g. c(.7, .3) which is the default}

\item{set_seed}{seed for reproducibility, defaults to 42}

\item{ntree}{integer, number of trees (defaults to 1000 trees)}

\item{...}{additional arguments}
}
\value{
trf object: list that contains the ROC AUC value and corresponding variable importance in training dataset (latter as ggplot object)
}
\description{
The function trains and fits a random forest model to assess the ability to predict missingness for
the specified covariate(s). If missing indicator can be predicted as a function of observed covariates,
MAR may be a likely scenario and would imply that imputation may be feasible.

#' #' Important: don't include variables like ID variables, ZIP codes, dates, etc.
}
\details{
The random forest utilizes the randomForest engine.
