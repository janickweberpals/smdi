\title{Computes Little's test}
\usage{
smdi_little(data = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe or tibble object with partially observed/missing variables}
}
\value{
returns a little object with statistics on little's test globally.
}
\description{
Littleâ€™s chi-squared test takes into account possible patterns of missingness across all variables in the dataset.
Rejection of the null hypothesis of this test would provide sufficient evidence to indicate that the data are (globally) not MCAR.
Please note that compared to \link{smdi_hotelling}, this function tests for MCAR globally across all missing covariates.

#' #' Important: don't include variables like ID variables, ZIP codes, dates, etc.
}
\details{
CAVE: Hotelling's and Little's show high susceptibility with large sample sizes and it is recommended to always interpret the results along with the other diagnostics.
