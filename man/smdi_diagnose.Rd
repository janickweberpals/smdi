\title{Computes three group missing data summary diagnostics}
\usage{
smdi_diagnose(
  data = NULL,
  covar = NULL,
  median = TRUE,
  includeNA = FALSE,
  train_test_ratio = c(0.7, 0.3),
  set_seed = 42,
  ntree = 1000,
  model = c("logistic", "linear", "cox"),
  form_lhs = NULL,
  exponentiated = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe or tibble object with partially observed/missing variables}

\item{covar}{character covariate or covariate vector with partially observed variable/column name(s) to investigate. If NULL, the function automatically includes all columns with at least one missing observation and all remaining covariates will be used as predictors}

\item{median}{logical if the median (= TRUE; recommended default) or mean of all absolute standardized mean differences (asmd) should be computed (smdi_asmd)}

\item{includeNA}{logical, should missingness of other partially observed covariates be explicitly modeled for computation of absoulate standardized mean differences (default is FALSE)}

\item{train_test_ratio}{numeric vector to indicate the test/train split ratio for random forest missingness prediction model, e.g. c(.7, .3) is the default}

\item{set_seed}{seed for reproducibility of random forest missingness prediction model, defaults to 42}

\item{ntree}{integer, number of trees for random forest missingness prediction model (defaults to 1000 trees)}

\item{model}{character describing which outcome model to fit to assess the association between covar missingness indicator and outcome. Currently supported are models of type logistic, linear and cox (see smdi_outcome)}

\item{form_lhs}{string specifying the left-hand side of the outcome formula (see smdi_outcome)}

\item{exponentiated}{logical, should results of outcome regression to assess association between missingness and outcome be exponentiated (default is FALSE)}
}
\value{
smdi object including a summary table of all three smdi group diagnostics.
}
\description{
This function bundles and calls all three group diagnostics and returns the most important summary metrics.
For more information and details, please refer to the individual functions.

Important: don't include variables like ID variables, ZIP codes, dates, etc.
}
\details{
Wrapper for individual diagnostics function.
