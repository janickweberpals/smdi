#' Computes mean/median absolute standardized mean differences between observed and missing observations
#'
#' @description
#' This function takes a dataframe with covariates which are partially observed/missing and returns the
#' median/average absolute standardized mean difference (asmd) and more details for every specified covariate in covar
#' (if NULL all covariates with at least one NA are considered).
#'
#' Important: don't include variables like ID variables, ZIP codes, dates, etc.
#'
#' @details
#' The asmd may be one indicator as to how much patient characteristics differ between patients with and without an observed
#' value for a partially observed covariate. If the median/average asmd is above a certain threshold this may indicate
#' imbalance in patient covariate distributions which may be indicative of the partially observed covariate following a
#' missing at random (MAR) mechanims, i.e. the missingness is explainable by other observed covariates. Similarly,
#' no imbalance between observed covariates may be indicative that missingness cannot be explained with observed
#' covariates and the underlying missingness mechanism may be completely at random (MCAR) or not at random (e.g.
#' missingness is only associated with unobserved factors or through the partially observed covariate itself).
#'
#' A clear cut-off is hard to determine and analogues to propensity scores,
#' some researchers have proposed that a standardized difference of 0.1 (10 per cent)
#' denotes meaningful imbalance in the baseline covariate.
#'
#' The asmd is computed for every covariate one-by-one and not jointly. If there is multivariate
#' missingness, i.e. more than just one missing covariate exists, you can decide what should
#' happen with the other partially observed 'predictor' covariates using the <includeNA> parameter.
#' That is, if <includeNA> is set to FALSE (default), only the asmd between observed cases will be computed,
#' and if <includeNA> is set to TRUE, missingness is modeled as an explicit category (categorical covariates only).
#'
#' If any other behavior is desired, data transformations for example with the \code{\link{smdi_na_indicator}} function, may make sense
#' before calling the function.
#'
#' The dataframe should generally consist of the exposure variable, the outcome variable(s), the partially observed covariates
#' and all other fully observed covariates which are deemed important for the final modeling
#' and (optionally) which could be considered as auxiliary variables. If no partially observed covariates are provided,
#' the function automatically looks for all variables/columns with NA (powered by the \code{\link{smdi_summarize}} function)

#' @param data dataframe or tibble object with partially observed/missing variables
#' @param covar character covariate or covariate vector with partially observed variable/column name(s) to investigate. If NULL, the function automatically includes all columns with at least one missing observation and all remaining covariates will be used as predictors
#' @param median logical if the median (= TRUE; recommended default) or mean of all absolute standardized mean differences (asmd) should be computed
#' @param includeNA logical, should missingness of other partially observed covariates be explicitly modeled (default is FALSE)
#'
#' @return returns an asmd object with mean/median absolute standardized mean differences
